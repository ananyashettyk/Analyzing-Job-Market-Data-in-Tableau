# Analyzing-Job-Market-Data-in-Tableau

In this Tableau case study, we’ll explore a real-world job posting dataset to uncover insights for a fictional recruitment company called DataSearch. We will use visualization techniques to investigate the data to find out what skills are most in-demand for data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers.

Starting by importing and cleaning a dataset, making sure it’s prepared for data exploration. Then use filters and calculated fields to build insightful visualizations of our findings, allowing for trend analysis. Finally, bringing it all together using Tableau's powerful dashboard capabilities so that we can answer questions for the DataSearch team.

By practicing the techniques we’ve learned so far, this Tableau case study gives us the chance to get some hands-on practice with a dataset. Once we’ve finished the project, we’ll be more confident using Tableau to present the data insights.
